# Skidplate

A Discord Bot written in Python that can get players/creation info from a [PLGarage](https://github.com/jackcaver/PLGarage) instance.

This project is based on my other [discord-bot](https://github.com/cotamilhas/discord-bot) repository.

Currently focusing on ModNation for PS3, but eventually LBPK will be also added at some point.
